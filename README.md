# Meteo_DataViz_Python
Analyzing and representing meteorological variables in famous towns along the French coast, over the past 6 years.

I started with a simple notebook, and next I'll try to build interactive visualisations / animations, potentially as a small Dash app. Historical data comes from meteorological stations in French coastal airports part of the METAR network.
